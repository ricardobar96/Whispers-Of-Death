## Concept

Dirty, grimy, moldy.
<br>
<br>
The place where rest dozens of memories.
<br>
<br>
Mementos of a past friendship brought you to this place.
<br>
<br>
And a bad deed that you don't even remember to commit.
<br>
<br>
Be aware of the bald, hurt enemy.
<br>
<br>
His eyes gleam with rage in the darkness. Apparently, you have misbehaved.
<br>
<br>
Each memento you collect fuels his hatred towards you.
<br>
<br>
But do not pity those who hides in the shadows.
<br>
<br>
And try to fix what seems forever broken.
<br>
